#### Resolving Signature Validation Errors in Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 and later validates that the debugging libraries that shipped with the .NET Runtime are signed before loading them. If they are unsigned, Visual Studio shows an error similar to the following:

> Unable to attach to CoreCLR. Signature validation failed for a .NET Runtime Debugger library because the file is unsigned.
>
> This error is expected if you are working with non-official releases of .NET (example: daily builds from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk). See https://aka.ms/vs/unsigned-dotnet-debugger-lib for more information.

This error occurs if the target process is using a daily build .NET Runtime or one that you built. **NOTE**: This error never happens with [released builds of the .NET Runtime from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet). ***Donâ€™t*** disable the validation if you are using an official release of the .NET Runtime.

The following approaches configure Visual Studio to disable signature validation:

1. The `VSDebugger_ValidateDotnetDebugLibSignatures` environment variable:
  * This is the easiest and recommended approach to temporarily disable signature validation.
  * At the command line, run `set VSDebugger_ValidateDotnetDebugLibSignatures=0` and then start Visual Studio (`devenv.exe`) from the same command prompt.
  * This setting is only valid for the Visual Studio instance that is started from the command prompt where the environment variable is set.
1. The [`DOTNET_ROOT` environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables#dotnet_root-dotnet_rootx86): if Visual Studio is started from a command prompt where `DOTNET_ROOT` is set, it ignores unsigned .NET runtime debugger libraries which are under the `DOTNET_ROOT` directory.
1. ***NOT RECOMMENDED** Set the `ValidateDotnetDebugLibSignatures` registry key: To disable signature validation on a more permanent basis, set the `Common7\IDE\VsRegEdit.exe set local HKCU Debugger\EngineSwitches ValidateDotnetDebugLibSignatures dword 0` VS registry key. For example, open a Developer Command Prompt and run `Common7\IDE\VsRegEdit.exe set local HKCU Debugger\EngineSwitches ValidateDotnetDebugLibSignatures dword 0`
